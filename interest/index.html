        <h2>Gaming</h2>
          <p>Basically, I like anything that has to do with brain power. I love
          to tackle any challenge that doesn't involve physical activity and has
          no consequence(s) (just in case I fail). With that description, it
          kind of shows why I like games. Though, don't get me wrong
          with the not liking to fail part, I do also like taking risk and
          learning from them. But anyways, here are some categories of games and
          what game I play within those categories:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Card games
            <ul>
              <li>13 or Tiến Lên in Vietnamese</li>
              <li>Blackjack</li>
              <li>UNO</li>
              <li>Card Against Humanity</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Video games
            <ul>
              <li>Any open world game</li>
              <li>Any Naruto game</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Board games
            <ul>
              <li>Sorry</li>
              <li>Monopoly</li>
              <li>Chess</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          </ol>
        <h2>Art</h2>
          <p> There is 3 art related activity I do that I love very much. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Origami</li>
          </ul>
            <p>For those who do not know what origami is, it is that
            art of folding paper. One may think, "What? just folding paper, I can do
            that." Well this may be true, origami is not just about folding paper,
            origami is folding paper to give it a shape of something else. Some
            examples are making a swan, crab, rocketships, and much much more.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Music</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Yes, I played instruments. Though it may be only during highschool
            that I played but those two years was the most fun I had in that
            school. The only set back to me continuing is money. Unlike what I
            said early how if I work hard enough I will get what I want, me
            getting my own instrument is highly unlikely. The instruments that
            I play (double bass and bassoon) cost roughly $800 to $5000. My part
            time job does not pay me enough money to afford it. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Model kits</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Three words, Life is hard. There are time when people just want to
            escape from reality and be in their own world, and how I do that
            is putting together model kits. As I mentioned earlier, I am a "Man
            Child" and I love robots. With that in mind doesn't it make sense that
            I like to put together Gundam model kits. Again for those who do not
            know what Gundam is, it is a japanese science fiction media franchise
            that feature giant robots witht the name Gundam. Building these not
            only relax my mind but also gives me hope that if they can make scale
            models of the robot it shouldn't be long until they can make one in
            real life.</p>
