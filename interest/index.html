        <h1> My interest </h1>
          <p>This page is to explain to everyone my interest and how my train of
          thought works</p>
      </article>
      <article id="topic">
        <h2>Man child</h2>
          <p>I admit, I am a man child. I love cartoons, animations, robots, and
          toys. This may have to do with that fact that when I was younger my mom
          once said that if I ever wanted anything (non-food and school related)
          I would have to work hard to make the money myself. I took this by heart
          and now bought a lot of things that normal children back in 2002 would
          have gotten from their parents. Such things include:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Power Rangers Megazord
            <ul>
              <li>spent about $120 for 2</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Yu-gi-oh cards
            <ul>
              <li>spent about $60+</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Airsoft guns
            <ul>
              <li>spent about $100+</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p>One might wonder what does this have to do with my thinking process?
          Well, this trait of mine shows that I work my very hardest to achieve
          whatever goal I desire. Weather it be a long term goal or a short term
          goal, I will achieve my desire one way or another.</p>
        <h2>Art</h2>
          <p> There is 3 art related things I do that I love very much. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Origami</li>
          </ul>
            <p>For those who do not know what origami is, it is that
            art of folding paper. One may think, "What? just folding paper, I can do
            that." Well this may be true, origami is not just about folding paper,
            origami is folding paper to give it a shape of something else. Some
            examples are making a swan, crab, rocketships, and much much more.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Music</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Yes, I played instruments. Though it may be only during highschool
            that I played but those two years was the most fun I had in that
            school. The only set back to me continuing is money. Unlike what I
            said early how if I work hard enough I will get what I want, me
            getting my own instrument is highly unlikely. The instruments that
            I play (double bass and bassoon) cost roughly $800 to $5000. My part
            time job does not pay me enough money to afford it. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Model kits</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Three words, Life is hard. There are time when people just want to
            escape from reality and be in their own world, and how I do that
            is putting together model kits. As I mentioned earlier, I am a "Man
            Child" and I love robots. With that in mind doesn't it make sense that
            I like to put together Gundam model kits. Again for those who do not
            know what Gundam is, it is a japanese science fiction media franchise
            that feature giant robots witht the name Gundam. Building these not
            only relax my mind but also gives me hope that if they can make scale
            models of the robot it shouldn't be long until they can make one in
            real life.</p>
